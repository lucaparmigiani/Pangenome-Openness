#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 88th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -2.18, 4.62, -3 -1
Accessory: 15.09, 15.53, 17 1
Unique: 6.14, 27.87, 0 -1

Median gain/loss when adding the 88th genome
Core: -1.0
Accessory: 11.0
Unique: 1.0

Highest unique gain 264 was caused by genome 55
Highest core loss -34 was caused by genome 55
