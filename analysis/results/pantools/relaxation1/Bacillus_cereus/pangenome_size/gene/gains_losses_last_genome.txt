#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 83th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -2.13, 3.22, 0 -1
Accessory: 142.94, 158.54, 0 53
Unique: 15.17, 237.04, 1 228

Median gain/loss when adding the 83th genome
Core: -1.0
Accessory: 97.0
Unique: 39.0

Highest unique gain 683 was caused by genome 23
Highest core loss -15 was caused by genome 8
