#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 50th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: 0.00, 0.00, 0 0
Accessory: 158.16, 204.90, 132 36
Unique: 29.90, 319.67, -46 -36

Median gain/loss when adding the 50th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 99.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 1573 was caused by genome 12
Highest core loss 0 was caused by genome 1
