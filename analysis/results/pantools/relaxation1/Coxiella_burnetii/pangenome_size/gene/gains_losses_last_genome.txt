#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 13th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -8.46, 15.72, 0 -30
Accessory: 32.00, 49.44, 4 19
Unique: 4.46, 77.74, 13 161

Median gain/loss when adding the 13th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 19.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 180 was caused by genome 13
Highest core loss -55 was caused by genome 10
