#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 35th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: 0.00, 0.00, 0 0
Accessory: 75.31, 159.03, 4 80
Unique: 227.66, 329.12, 560 369

Median gain/loss when adding the 35th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 2.0
Unique: 378.0

Highest unique gain 567 was caused by genome 29
Highest core loss 0 was caused by genome 1
