#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 57th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -1.89, 4.02, -18 0
Accessory: 8.95, 16.43, 8 41
Unique: 6.21, 33.03, 41 -32

Median gain/loss when adding the 57th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 2.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 177 was caused by genome 25
Highest core loss -18 was caused by genome 1
