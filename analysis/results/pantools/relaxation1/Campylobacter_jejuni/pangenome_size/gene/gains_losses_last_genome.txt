#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 234th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -0.41, 1.39, 0 0
Accessory: 6.45, 10.55, 5 1
Unique: 1.19, 14.98, 1 -1

Median gain/loss when adding the 234th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 3.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 169 was caused by genome 56
Highest core loss -15 was caused by genome 170
