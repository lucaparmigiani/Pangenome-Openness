#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 56th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -5.07, 10.96, -1 -49
Accessory: 7.82, 21.66, 1 1
Unique: 6.79, 27.06, 6 6

Median gain/loss when adding the 56th genome
Core: -1.0
Accessory: 3.0
Unique: 6.0

Highest unique gain 77 was caused by genome 8
Highest core loss -49 was caused by genome 47
