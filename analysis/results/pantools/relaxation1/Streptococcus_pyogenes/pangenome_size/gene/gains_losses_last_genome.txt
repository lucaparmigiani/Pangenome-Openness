#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 247th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -0.52, 1.74, 0 0
Accessory: 6.41, 8.40, 5 3
Unique: 1.09, 9.47, -1 -3

Median gain/loss when adding the 247th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 3.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 79 was caused by genome 223
Highest core loss -20 was caused by genome 86
