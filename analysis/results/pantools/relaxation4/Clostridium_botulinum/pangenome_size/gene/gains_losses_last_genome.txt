#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 50th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -0.86, 3.50, 0 -2
Accessory: 79.68, 113.86, 12 439
Unique: -13.46, 127.69, -7 -98

Median gain/loss when adding the 50th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 42.0
Unique: -4.0

Highest unique gain 500 was caused by genome 14
Highest core loss -21 was caused by genome 40
