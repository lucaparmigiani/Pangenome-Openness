#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 56th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -4.02, 11.23, 0 -34
Accessory: 1.75, 3.41, 0 2
Unique: 4.04, 10.07, 1 0

Median gain/loss when adding the 56th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 1.0
Unique: 3.0

Highest unique gain 66 was caused by genome 9
Highest core loss -53 was caused by genome 50
