#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 35th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -0.20, 0.67, 0 0
Accessory: 11.66, 15.04, 16 5
Unique: 58.09, 96.83, -16 231

Median gain/loss when adding the 35th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 6.0
Unique: 5.0

Highest unique gain 306 was caused by genome 15
Highest core loss -3 was caused by genome 20
