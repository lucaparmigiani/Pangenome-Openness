#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 88th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -1.50, 3.83, -1 0
Accessory: 6.45, 9.23, 3 2
Unique: 0.58, 11.48, -2 2

Median gain/loss when adding the 88th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 3.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 134 was caused by genome 26
Highest core loss -27 was caused by genome 26
