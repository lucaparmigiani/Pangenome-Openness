#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 13th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -6.38, 12.07, 0 0
Accessory: 9.85, 15.43, 1 0
Unique: 5.85, 36.49, -1 0

Median gain/loss when adding the 13th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 5.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 127 was caused by genome 2
Highest core loss -37 was caused by genome 4
