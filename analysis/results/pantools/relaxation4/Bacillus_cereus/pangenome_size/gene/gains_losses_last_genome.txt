#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 83th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -2.43, 4.69, -8 0
Accessory: 61.83, 77.03, 100 20
Unique: -4.43, 106.28, -82 18

Median gain/loss when adding the 83th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 44.0
Unique: 12.0

Highest unique gain 349 was caused by genome 7
Highest core loss -29 was caused by genome 11
