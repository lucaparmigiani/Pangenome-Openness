#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 57th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -1.39, 4.08, 0 0
Accessory: 4.00, 9.64, 0 0
Unique: 3.02, 19.76, 0 0

Median gain/loss when adding the 57th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 0.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 124 was caused by genome 30
Highest core loss -26 was caused by genome 20
