#Each genome is added to the pangenome of the remaining genomes to identify the number of groups gained (accessory, unique) or lost (core, unique)

Average gain/loss when adding the 234th genome, standard deviation, range 
Core: -0.19, 1.40, -1 0
Accessory: 2.47, 2.69, 0 5
Unique: -0.48, 3.36, 0 -5

Median gain/loss when adding the 234th genome
Core: 0.0
Accessory: 2.0
Unique: 0.0

Highest unique gain 26 was caused by genome 74
Highest core loss -21 was caused by genome 39
